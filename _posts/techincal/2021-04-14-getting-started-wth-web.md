If we have the right guindance and mentoring we can hack time. ( Benjamin p hardy - [Slipstream time hacking](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B019MZ6BRO))
With the right guidance we can learn things much faster.

I am very fortunate to get mentored and trained well through out my career.
I am sharing some information which helped me learn web and related technologies.
Whether you want to be a programmer, a hacker, or just exploring the web technologies, these are the suggestions based on my experience.
