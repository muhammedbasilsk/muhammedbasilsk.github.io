title: How event based architecture helped me think big
---

Event based architecture changed the way I think and approach to software solutions. 

I am very fortunate to work in multiple technologies and programming languages from the very beginning of the career.
And it helped in many ways especially rather than thinking in a one way door to multiple ways to solve a problem.

Each technology or programming language has design choices that will help us shape our thoughts.
I worked in multiple projects to build applications for web and mobile. And it ended there.
