Eat that frog  
Who moved my cheese

Indistractable  
Kindle: Make every word count  


In my shelf:
Think and grow rich  
12 Rules of life  
May be you should talk to someone  
How to win friends and influence people  
Power  

The psychology of money  

And many more. Now I have made the habit of buying good books, (getting into the reading habits very slowly though). Even though the books are available in kindle or other apps, I would like my kids to have the habit of reading books. So I am collecting for the next generation and I beleive it is a good investment.
