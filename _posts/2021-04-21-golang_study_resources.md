title: Resources I found helpful to learn golang
---

I have used a lot of resources to learn goloang programming language. All of them even if it is a very small video or an article or a discussion itself found useful one way or other.

Adding some of the resources below which I came across. There are a ton of other greater resources out there still which I might get chance to learn one day.

I am consolidating it here so that it might help someone to save some time in doing google search.


Udemy
Reddit channel
Golang with examples
Golang with testing
