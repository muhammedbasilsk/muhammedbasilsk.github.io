Father of two angels, a software professional, and a big batman fan.

Day to day life, I get to see and learn from a lot of people, people from around the world. Since they were so kind to spend their precious time (v/b)logging it I was able to learn many things and save a ton of time.

So I decided to make my own space and capture my thoughts and learnings so that may be oneday someone will find some useful information here as well.

The world around us is teaching a lot of things in every moment and here are a lot of things I am passionate about. And this will be a repository where I will be capturing my thoughts experiences and some of the work I do.
